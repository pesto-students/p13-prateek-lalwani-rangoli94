                Snakebite can kill over 100,000 people each year and is considered one of the world's deadliest
                neglected health issues. But what does venom actually do to you? Venom is thought to have evolved
                independently at least 100 times. Today there are thousands of venomous animals thriving around the
                world and over time their venoms have evolved to do specific jobs in the animals they
                envenomate.Discover what snake venom does, why some species have incredibly potent venom, and why speed
                is so important when treating snakebite. You are most likely to encounter a rattlesnake when walking,
                hiking, climbing, or camping. You're likely to find rattlesnakes around rocks, shrubs, tall grasses, and
                brush. They like hot surfaces and you'll often see them sunning themselves on rocks, pavement, or
                trails.

                Lots of animals use venom for predation, killing or immobilising their prey before eating it. It is also
                commonly used for defence, serving would-be predators with a painful and memorable warning.

                There are about 700 species of front-fanged venomous snakes, almost all of which belong to the families
                Viperidae and Elapidae. There are an additional 1,800 rear-fanged species which belong to the family
                Colubridae. Many of these are likely to be venomous too, though this group generally poses less of a
                threat to humans, with a few exceptions.

                Almost all snakes evolved venom to help them hunt but some will also use it defend themselves.

                Almost all snakes evolved venom to help them hunt. But what the venom does to a prey item's body depends
                on the snake species.
                There are several other less common uses for venom. For example, male platypuses use their venomous
                spurs against their competition in the breeding season, tawny crazy ants use theirs as an antidote to
                the venom of fire ants and some species, such as shrews, are thought to use their venom to preserve
                food.

                Two groups of venomous snakes are particularly well known: vipers (Viperidae) and elapids (Elapidae).
                Broadly speaking, the venoms in these two groups do different things to a bite victim.

                Vipers, which includes adders and rattlesnakes, have venoms that are generally haemotoxic. This means
                they attack the circulatory system. They can cause bleeding or interfere with the blood's ability to
                clot.

                Many famously venomous snakes are elapids, such as cobras, mambas, kraits and taipans. Their venom is
                typically neurotoxic, which means that it interferes with the transmission of nerve impulses. It
                generally has an immobilising effect, either making a victim's body turn rigid or become limp.

                What to Do If Bitten by a Rattlesnake
            <ol>
                <li>Remain calm.</li>
                <li>Seek immediate medical attention by dialing 911 or calling your local poison center -
                    1-800-222-1222.</li>
                <li>Keep the bitten arm, leg, or body part at or slightly below heart level.</li>
                <li>Note the time the bite happened. Avoid trying to capture or kill the snake, but try to remember its
                    color and shape so you can describe it. This can help with medical treatment. If you can do so
                    safely and without delay, take a photo.</li>
                <li>Remove all tight clothing or jewelry.</li>
                <li>Do not cut the bite or try to suck the venom out.</li>
                <li>Leave the bite site alone. Do not use any first aid measures such as applying heat, cold,
                    electricity or any substance to the bite.</li>
                <li>Avoid allowing the victim to drink caffeine or alcohol or take any drugs.</li>
                <li>Transport the victim to a hospital as quickly as possible, but use care and do not convert the snake
                    bite emergency into a traffic accident. It's best to go by ambulance.</li>
